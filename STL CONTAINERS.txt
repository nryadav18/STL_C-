STL has 4 components:

--> Algorithms
--> Containers
--> Functors
--> Iterators

1. Algorithms
The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially 
designed to be used on a range of elements. They act on containers 
and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.

~ Algorithm
~ Sorting
~ Searching
~ Important STL Algorithms
~ Useful Array algorithms
~ Partition Operations
~ Numeric
~ valarray class

2. Containers
Containers or container classes store objects and data. 
There are in total seven standards “first-class” container 
classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven 
header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

Sequence Containers: implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner.
~ vector
~ list
~ deque
~ arrays
~ forward_list( Introduced in C++11)

Container Adaptors: provide a different interface for sequential containers.
~ queue
~ priority_queue
~ stack

Associative Containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
~ set
~ multiset
~ map
~ multimap

Unordered Associative Containers: implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
~ unordered_set (Introduced in C++11)
~ unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11)
~ unordered_map (Introduced in C++11)
~ unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)

PREPARE WELL, ALL THE VERY BEST...!
